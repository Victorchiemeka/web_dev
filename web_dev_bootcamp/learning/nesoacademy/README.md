Two important reasons to use function

Reuseability: once a function is defined, it can be reused over and ovet again 

Abstraction: If you are just using the function in your program than you dont have to worry about how it works inside e.g printf.

Parameter is a variable in the declaration and definition of the function
Arguement is the value of the parameter get passed in the functions

Pointers are those variable that can store addresses of other variable
